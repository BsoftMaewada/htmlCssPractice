        <p>
            Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1tbs buttered</li>
            <li>2tbs cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
            <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
            <li>Once the butter melt add the eggs and cream</li>
            <li>Using a spatula fold the egg from the edge of the pan
                to the center of every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)
            </li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to 
                cook on the plate until served)</li>
        </ol>
